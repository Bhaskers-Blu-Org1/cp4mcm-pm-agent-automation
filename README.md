Use Red Hat Ansible Tower to integrate your IBM Tivoli Monitoring V6, and APM V8 agents to the IBM Cloud Pak​​​​​ for Multicloud Management. Automate agent integration to the Cloud Pak, and take advantage of large-scale bulk deployments during off peak hours. Also, use Red Hat Ansible Tower to automate and streamline 'greenfield' agent deployment in IBM Cloud Pak​​​​​ for Multicloud Management. A greenfield agent is an agent that can be installed directly on your VMs for on-premise or Kubernetes clusters.

IBM provides playbooks in a GitHub repository for common tasks that are involved in agent integration and deployment. These playbooks can be used in Ansible Tower templates.
